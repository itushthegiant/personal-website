  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I born and raised in Israel in a city named Rishon Le Zion and i came to the US in 2017.
    I did all kind of jobs back in Israel and Iâ€™m currently working for a finance company here in NY.
    When the whole pandemic started I was kind of stuck and like many others i was looking for a new direction in life so I started to learn code HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT and more.</p>
