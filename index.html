    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I born and raised in Israel in 1991 in a city named Rishon Le Zion.<br>
        I was a European handball player for ten years and I left the team when I graduated high school.<br>
        After graduation I went to there army and did 3 years as soldier in the IDF which was a big experience (both good and bad).<br>
        After I finished my service I was traveling in Europe for a bit and then I went for my “Big trip” as we say in Israel.<br> I was backpacking in South America for 5 months (Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia), I sure miss those days.<br>
        After I came back from South America I was working in all kinds of jobs as a cook, bartender and more…<br> in 2017 I got accepted to a finance company in NYC and I went for it right away.<br>
        When the whole pandemic started I felt stuck and I started to learn some web development and I saw I really like it, so now the next big step is to successfully finish the coding bootcamp in Flatiron school.
